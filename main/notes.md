!!!DON't FORGET TO SORT OUT THE PACKAGING OF THE PROGRAME!!!
I need to complete wrapQoutation func to behave like the loop for the finalText adjustment loop to remove the double spaces from the inside of the qoutation before returning it
The loop has been copies but will require to be redacted to the case of the spaces. A new [][]byte needs to be created to feed the updated bytes into it for returning
